# **ChessRing Project**

## **Overview**
The **ChessRing Project** integrates computer vision and wearable technology to revolutionize chess gameplay. By using a camera to track moves and a vibrating ring to provide feedback, the system aims to improve decision-making and enhance the chess-playing experience.



## **Features**
- **Move Detection**: Camera tracks chess piece movements in real-time.
- **Haptic Feedback**: Vibrating ring provides feedback on move quality.
- **Modular System**: Designed for future integration of motion-tracking sensors in the ring.
- **Skill Improvement**: Offers real-time evaluation to refine strategic play.



## **Current Status**
### **Hardware**
- Camera successfully set up for move detection.
- Ring integration for feedback is under development.

### **Software**
- Move detection pipeline is being tested with simulated data.
- Feedback mechanism is in design to align with move evaluation.

### **Progress**
- Connectivity setup is almost complete.
- Current focus: refining the detection pipeline and designing the feedback loop.
